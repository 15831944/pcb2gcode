This is the experimental branch of pcb2gcode.

* I'm currently working on a simple optimisation algorithm to reduce milling
  time and tool wear that will be part of the next release.

* The next release will be a complete rewrite in C++.

The availability of this through SVN is merely for my own convienience.
Once the rewrite is usable and tested reasonably well, I'll put it in trunk
and make an announcement on the pcb2gcode wiki.
